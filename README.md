*Why are online reviews important?*

On these last few years, online reviews have played a large role in digital marketing and sales. Customers constantly read online reviews to discern if they should buy a product, hire a company, visit a destination, eat a restaurant, etc.

Reviews are also a great way for companies to connect with costumers, to take in mind the bad and good review so they can keep, upgrade, change, discard how things work around the marketing of the product/service; reason why companies use different processes
