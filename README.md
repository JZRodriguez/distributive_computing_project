## Introduction
Amazon reviews are a way to connect with users to help other users to know the quality of a certain product or seller. With this, Amazon's shop can figure out what are the best selling items in the store, either being classified in different categories or general, and recommend them to user that are looking for an item on a specific categorie. Since Amazon's shop is one of the biggest shopping platforms, it's important to understand how the recommendations work.

*Why are online reviews important?*

On these last few years, online reviews have played a large role in digital marketing and sales. Customers constantly read online reviews to discern if they should buy a product, hire a company, visit a destination, eat a restaurant, etc.

Reviews are also a great way for companies to connect with costumers, to take in mind the bad and good review so they can keep, upgrade, change, discard how things work around the marketing of the product/service; reason why companies use different processes
